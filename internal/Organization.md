(â€ )Department-locked, MDIT

All changes to the lawbook should be made as pull requests to the lawbook's Github (https://github.com/MDofIT-sk/grandoutline). This should be cited as the changes during decision-making. The MDIT will merge the request as long as proper proof is cited (ex. the PDF for the passed bill).

## Discord Server
The Discord Server for the Saheok Parliament serves as the communication epicentre of the government. Announce changes (bills) and statements there right to the public, and also announce proposed changed to your respective department/the Parliament.

## Decision Making
Parliamentary decisions should be proposed by making a folder in the Parliament Google Drive, with a document outlining the proposed changes based on the bill template. For other departments' processes, this can be different. It should be brought up in the Parliament/Department, and the progress of the proposed change documented in the document as per the template (process may be different for individual departments). Once passed, it is ONLY then given a bill # (for departments, it is "(Department Acronym) Bill #") and added to a "decided" folder to to safekeep. The document should be also duplicated as a PDF, which will be shared (added to archives, etc). The passed bill should be announced in the Discord server to the public.

## Other Statements
Other statements can be made by departments or offices or individuals, and should be kept in the archives "To do" unless there is an otherwise appropriate location. Stick to PDF for sharing. They must also be announced to the Parliament, and/or the public through the Discord server.

## Archives
All bills and other documents should be announced to the public in the Discord server, but it is also required that someone put the final PDF of any decision or statement in the "To do" folder within the Public Archives folder. Archives staff will make sure it makes its way onto the Archives website.
