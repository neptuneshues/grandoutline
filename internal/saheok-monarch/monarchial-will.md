# Monarchial Will

This is the will of Hue regarding their reign as monarch.

> Crown TimothÃ©e Chalamet if I die or abdicate on Saheok, Canadian, or other British Commonwealth territory. If I die/abdicate in a country not mentioned without signs of being forced to, dissolve the government in its entirety without question. The rest of this will is privately available to the Prime Minister's office.
